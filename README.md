# Battery Health Classifier 🔋⚡

This is a Streamlit-based machine learning app that predicts battery health using input parameters like:

- 🔥 Temperature (°C)
- ⚡ Voltage (V)
- 🔌 Current (A)

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/batteryhealthclassifier.git
cd batteryhealthclassifier
2.pip install -r requirements.txt
3.streamlit run BatteryHealthApp.py
🧠 Model
The model is trained using historical battery performance data. It outputs the health prediction based on live input values.
📁 Files Included
